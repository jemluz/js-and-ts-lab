# Copilot Instructions

## Project intent
This repo is a didactic lab for JavaScript and TypeScript. Keep content small, focused, and comment-driven.

## What to optimize for
- Clarity over completeness
- Short examples that compile or run
- Comments that explain the rule or the reason

## When adding or editing topics
- Prefer one concept per file
- Keep examples minimal but real
- Use TypeScript when types clarify behavior
- Keep filenames descriptive and consistent with folders

## Documentation rules
- Update README.md and docs/index.md when adding new topics
- Keep bilingual text aligned
- Avoid non-ASCII characters unless the file already uses them

## Quick map
- control-structures
- data-storage
- functions
- modules (historical evolution)
- object-oriented
- operators
- scopes
