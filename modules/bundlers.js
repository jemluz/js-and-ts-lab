// Bundlers and they impact on module systems.

// Bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, and Parcel have made it possible to use different module systems seamlessly in browser environments.
// They can take modules written in CommonJS, ESM, or other formats and bundle them into a single file that browsers can understand.

// Join files, solve imports, optimize code for better performance, and manage dependencies effectively.

// Advantages of Using Bundlers
// 1. Compatibility: Allows the use of various module systems in browsers.
// 2. Optimization: Bundlers can optimize code by minifying and tree-shaking unused code.
// 3. Asset Management: Can handle not just JavaScript but also CSS, images, and other assets.

// Disadvantages of Using Bundlers
// 1. Complexity: Adds an extra layer of complexity to the development process.
// 2. Build Time: Increases build times, especially for large projects.
// 3. Configuration: Requires configuration which can be daunting for beginners.
